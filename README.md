### Hello, fellow coderðŸ‘‹

My name is Kenneth Hanson and I am currently completing my coursework towards a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics. 

For as long as I can remember, I have been an empiricist and scientist--empiricist in that I like to validate hypothesis with data, and a scientist because I like to hypothesize and test my hypotheses. I am currently scouring the market for roles in data analysis, data engineering, database administration, cloud architecture, or cybersecurity. Much of these fields have overlapping skillsets that transfer easily with each other. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning (ML) with Python
